## Core Workflow Principles

### 1. ALWAYS PLAN FIRST - NO IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION
- **NEVER start implementing code immediately**
- Always provide a comprehensive plan before any code changes
- Wait for explicit approval before proceeding with implementation
- If user asks for a feature/fix, respond with planning phase first

### 2. BIG PICTURE ANALYSIS REQUIRED
When presenting any solution, always include:

#### Multiple Options Analysis
- Present 2-3 different approaches when possible
- Explain pros and cons of each option
- Highlight trade-offs (complexity vs speed, maintainability vs quick fix, etc.)

#### Impact Assessment
- What parts of the system will be affected
- Dependencies and potential risks
- Required testing scope
